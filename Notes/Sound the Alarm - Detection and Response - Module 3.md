## Response and Recovery

### Business continuity considerations

#### Business continuity planning

Security teams must be prepared to minimize the impact that security incidents can have on their normal business operations. WHen an incident occurs, organizations might experience significant disruptions to the functionality of their systems and services. Organizations can use business continuity planning so that they can remain operational during any major disruptions.

A **business continuity plan (BCP)** is a document that outlines the procedures to sutatin business operations during and after a significant disruption. A BCP helps organizations ensure that critical business functions can resume or can be quickly restored when an incident occurs.

Business continuity plans are not the same as *disaster recovery plans*. Disaster recovery plans are used to recover information systems in response to a major disaster.

##### Consider the impacts of ransomware to business continuity

Impscts of a sceurity incident such as ransomware can be devastating for business operations. Depending on the severity of a ransomware attack, the accessibility, availability, and delivery of essential healthcare services can be impacted. At a larger scale, security incidents that target the assetss, systems, and networks of critical infrastructure can also undermine national security, economic security, and the health and safety of the public.

##### Recovery strategies

BCPs can include strategies for recovery that focus on returning to normal operations. Site resilience is one example of a recovery strategy.

##### Site resilience

**Resilience** is the ability to prepare for, responde to, and recover from disruptions. Organizations can design their systems to be resilient so that they can continue delivering services despite facing disruptions. There are three types of sites used for site resilience:

- **Hot sites**: A fully operational facility that is a duplicate of an organization's primary environment. Hot sites can be activated immediately when an organization's primary site experiences failure or disruption.

- **Warm sites**: A facility that contains fully updated and configured version of the hot site. Unlike hot sites, warm sites are not fully operational and available for immediate use but can quickly be made operational when a failure or disruption occurs.

- **Cold sites**: A backup facility equipped with some of the necessary infrastructure required to operate an organization's site. When a disruption or failure occurs, cold sites might not be ready for immediate use and might need additional work to be operational.

## Post-incident actions

### The post-incident activity phase of the lifecycle

The **post-incident activity phase**  entails the process of reviewing an incident to identify areas for improvement during incident handling.

One critical form of documentation that gets created is the final report. The final report is documentation that provides a comprehensive review of an incident. It includes a timeline and details of all events related to the incident and recommendation for future prevention.

During an incident, the goal of the security team is to focus efforts on response and recovery. After an incident, security teams work to minimize the risk of it happening again.

One way to improve processes is to hold a lessons learned meeting. A **lessons learned meeting** includes all parties involved in the incident and is generally held within two weeks after the incident. During this meeting, the incident is reviewed to determine what happened, what actions were taken, and how well the actions worked. The final report is also used as the main reference document during this meeting. The goal is to share ideas and information about the incident and how to improve furute reponse efforts.

#### Questions to ask

- What happened?

- What time did it happen?

- Who discovered it?

- How did it get contained?

- What were the actions taken for recovery?

- What could have been done differently?

## Post-incident review

### Post-incident activity

The Post-incident activity phase of the NIST Incident Response Lifecycle is the process of reviewing an incident to identify areas for improvement during incident handling.

### Lessons learned

Incidents provide organizations and their security teams with an opportunity to learn from what happened and prioritize ways to improve the incident handling process.

This is typically done through a **lessons learned meeting**, also known as a post-mortem.  Depending on the scope of an incident, multiple meetings can be scheduled to gather sufficient data. The purpose of this meeting is to evaluate the incident in its entirety, assess the response actions, and identify any areas of improvement.

Not all incidents require their own lessons learned meeting; the size and severity of an incident will dictate whether the meeting is necessary.

Besides having the opportunity to learn from the incident, there are additional benefits to conducting a lessons learned meeting. For large organizations, lessons learned meetings offer a platform for team members across departments to share information and recommendations for future prevention.

#### Recommendations

Lessons learned meetings provide opportunities for growth and improvement. For example, security teams can identify errors in response actions, gaps in processes and procedures, or ineffective security controls. A lessons learned meeting should result in a list of prioritized actions or actionable recommendations meant to improve an organization’s incident handling processes and overall security posture.

### Final report

One of the most essential forms of documentation that gets created during the end of an incident is the final report. The final report provides a comprehensive review of an incident. Final reports are not standardized, and their formats can vary across organizations. Additionally, multiple final reports can be created depending on the audience it’s written for. Here are some examples of common elements found in a final report:

- **Executive summary**: A high-level summary of the report including the key findings and essential facts related to the incident

- **Timeline**:  A detailed chronological timeline of the incident that includes timestamps dating the sequence of events that led to the incident

- **Investigation**: A compilation of the actions taken during the detection and analysis of the incident. For example, analysis of a network artifact such as a packet capture reveals information about what activities happen on a network.

- **Recommendations**: A list of suggested actions for future prevention

Considering the audience when writing a final report will help you effectively communicate the most important details.
