# The incident response lifecycle

Incident lifecycle frameworks provide a structure to support incident response operations. Frameworks help organizations develop a standarized approach to their incident response process, so that incidents are managed i an effective and consistent way.

The NIST incident response lifecycle is another NIST framework with additional substeps dedicated to incident response. It begins with preparation. Next, detection and analysis, and then containment, eradication and recovery, and infally post-incident activity.

An **incident** is "an occurrence that actually or imminently jeopardizes, without lawful authority, the confidentiality, integrity, or vailability of information or an information system; or consititues a violation or imminent threat of violation of law, secury policies, security procedures, or acceptable use policies.

All security incidents are events, but not all events are incidents. An **event** is an observable occurrence on a network, system, or device.

An incident investigatio reveals critical information about the five W's of an incident: who trigerred the incident, what happened, when the incident took place, where the incident took place, and why the incident occurred.

Keeping track of this information is essential not only during an incident investigation, but also during the closure of an investigation when it comes time to write the final report.
