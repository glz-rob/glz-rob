# Vulnerability Assessment Report

<small>1st January 20XX</small>

---

## System Description

The server hardware consists of a powerful CPU processor and 128GB of memory. It runs on the latest version of Linux operating system and hosts a MySQL database management system. It is configured with a stable network connection using IPv4 addresses and interacts with other servers on the network. Security measures include SSL/TLS encrypted connections.

## Scope

The scope of this vulnerability assessment relates to the current access controls of the system. The assessment will cover a period of three months, from June 20XX to August 20XX. NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 is used to guide the risk analysis of the information system.

## Purpose

The database server contains all the company's information necessary for business operations. It is important that the data on the server is secured, for compliance and business operations reasons. The company could face financial consequences if it doesn't comply with legal regulations about Personal Identifiable Information (PII) and Sensitive PII management. Adding up to this, the database is necessary to keep the business running, if it were to be disable the company wouldn't be able to keep operations up.

## Risk Assessment

| Threat source | Threat event  | Likelihood    | Severity  | Risk  |
| :- | :- | :- | :- | :- |
| *E.g. Competitor* | *Obtain sensitive information via exfiltration*   | *3* | *3* | *9* |
| Hacker | Install persistent and targeted network sniffers on organizational information systems. | 2 | 3 | 6 |
| Network Outages   | Disrupt mission-critical operations. | 2 | 2 | 4 |

## Approach

The mentioned risks are some common and plausible seucirty incidents. The likelihood was determined based on estimations of how often this kind of incidents occur in the industry. It is not possible to know if the company is going to be target of any of these incidents or when are they going to occur, but we can always prepare.

## Remediation Strategy

Adding Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) will add a layer of security to the database, making it harder for unauthorized users to hack their way into the database system. Having a backup server will reduce the severity of network outages on the server's side, although it will not eliminate it. This assessment gives us a clear path to increase security.
