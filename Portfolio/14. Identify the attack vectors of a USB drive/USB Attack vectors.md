# Parking lot of USB exercise

    <th>Contents</th>
    <td>
      The USB contents include what seems to be Jorge's resume, a list of wedding invitees, and employee budget, among other things. Personal and work file should not be stored together, company assets should not be treated as personal files, and should have a high standard of security.

    <th>Attacker mindset</th>
    <td>
      If found by a threat actor, the PII stored in the USB drive could be used to impersonate Jorge or even someone else. The attacker could use this information to scam family members or other employees. The stored information also contain business knowledge like employee budget, and the new hire letter, which could contain PII from other employees and trade secrets.

    <th>Risk analysis</th>
    <td>
      USB drives could contain any kind of data, including malware. If the device was infected and plugged in by an employee, it could give the malicious actor access to the network, from there the atacker could access anything the employee has access to or it could set a backdoor for future attacks. Work computers should scan all the devices connected to them and shouldn't execute them by default. Employees should be given a training about the risks of connecting unknown devices to a computer. Finally, workstations and servers could have physical locks on the ports, so no one can't plug devices without consent.
